# Emilberbakovangular

This is the front end of my professional website, emilberbakov.com, written in Angular and TypeScript.
This front end takes advantage of the backend and APIs I developed in [my ASP.NET CORE redesign of EmilBerbakov.com](https://github.com/EmilBerbakov/emilberbakovdotnetitsdotcom).

Why Angular and why redesign the website *again*?  Mainly, to keep my developer chops up.  I understand the concepts of Angular and TypeScript, and I wanted to whip this up as a demonstration of my ability to use both.  I've already developed the C# version of my APIs, so I can spend this development time purely on the front end.
