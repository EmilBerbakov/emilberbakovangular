                Hello and welcome to my page! My name is Emil, (pronounced "AY-mull"). I also respond to "Eh-mull", "EE-mull", "Eh-meal", and anything in-between.<br/>
                Over the past five years, I have held positions in the fields of engineering and information technology. I have a passion for the integration of creativity and functionality: creating things that work well and look better.<br/>
                I was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I currently live in Madison, Wisconsin with my wife, Maria, and our two cats, Buzz and Woody. I enjoy drinking coffee, going on long drives, playing video games, making music, and, of course, reading a good book.
